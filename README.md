Created with CodeSandbox
I created an interactive anniversary web app using CodeSandbox to celebrate a special milestone. The app features a beautifully animated interface, personalized messages, and interactive elements such as clickable hearts, image slideshows, and a quiz to create an emotional and memorable experience.

The design includes smooth transitions, confetti effects, and responsive layouts that adjust perfectly to mobile and desktop screens. Users can explore different sections like “Our Journey,” “Favorite Memories,” and “Special Message,” each brought to life with modern web technologies such as React, CSS animations, and Framer Motion for dynamic effects.

This project showcases both creativity and technical skill, combining aesthetic design with interactive storytelling to make the anniversary celebration more engaging and heartfelt.
